Added ox_lib notifications.This optimized the resource (down from around a 0.07 resmon to a (0.00-0.01 inactive and a 0.03 active)
I also Added pump prop in hand as well as Interact-sounds for pump.

### Changes
```
1.) OG LegacyFuel also had an issue where sitting in a vehicle would raise resmoon a 0.06. That is fixed.
2.) Updated from a resource.lua to a fxmanifest.lua.
3.) Switched all 3d texts to ox_lib UI's and notifications.
4.) Added Fuel Prop in hand
5.) Added Pump sounds via interact sound.
